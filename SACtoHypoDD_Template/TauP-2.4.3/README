The manual for the TauP Toolkit can be found in doc/taup.pdf. A copy of the TauP paper published in SRL can be found in doc/SRL_paper/taup_srl_with_figs.pdf.

Scripts for the various tool for both unix (sh) and windows (bat) are in the bin directory.

We use gradle to compile TauP. Should you wish to recompile, the gradlew wrapper will download gradle and compile. For example 'gradle/gradlew jar' will compile the java source and create a new jar. 'gradle eclipse' will generate an eclipse project files for importing. More information can be found at http://www.gradle.org.
